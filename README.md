Job Application
===============

Summary
-------

This is a job application for a larger project which involves the use of [node.js](http://nodejs.org), npm, [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/), [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) and [MySQL](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql).

There are some errors in the existing files that you will need to fix.  In addition, you must complete some missing functionality.  Do the minimum amount of work to complete the tasks.  Maintain existing coding conventions & style.

This test should take about **10 - 15 minutes** if you have the requisite expertise.

Failure to follow the instructions precisely will disqualify you.

Instructions
------------

You should create a **separate git commit** for each of the steps below (except #1):

1. Clone this repository (DO NOT fork)
2. Fix the errors in the source files so the database can be loaded
3. Fix the errors in the source files so the application runs & the web page loads in your browser, including the CSS
4. Get the application to print 'Hello World' when the main page is loaded
5. Change the text color to blue by modifying the Stylus
6. Change the text output to an H1 by modifying the Jade
7. Take a picture of the web page in your browser and put it in a `screenshots` directory
    * include the address bar and browser tab in the image
    * add this file to git and commit it

### Tips

* Set up your database configuration first.  Then use the `Makefile` targets for database creation and running the app.

Submission
----------

1. Zip up **ONLY** your `.git` directory in zip format and attach it to your Upwork application or Upwork Messenger conversation.
